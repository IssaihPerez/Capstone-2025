    How do I approach designing software?
        What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
            I have learned more about the reality of creating a project and how the actual elements can help create a more enhanced image
            and better enhance the image I am trying to convey. Lighting and textures are great examples about how adding reflections or
            shadows can give the scene so much more detail and depth than just recreating images using shapes.
        What design process did you follow for your project work?
            I followed most of the guidelines that were given to me for the projects, and I do appreciate that all the modules for this 
            course built up to a culmination of the final project, as it made things so much more easier to understand as each week I had 
            to learn what to do in the initial assignment, then implement that towards the project and get feedback and work from there 
            each and every week.
        How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
            Learning things step by step and practicing them initially and then implementing them with my newfound knowledge is a great 
            tactic as I will always be a step ahead and won't be behind in the learning curve. I also now have a more expanded upon knowledge
            about what other details I would add when creating a 'realistic' scene. 
    How do I approach developing programs?
        What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
            Mainly messing around with the different values and positionings is how I got my work to be how it is, as practicing and 
            experimenting with different combinations allowed me to understand how things worked better together and compare and contrast
            the differences between the values. 
        How did iteration factor into your development?
            After going through the different designing cycles, testing my different cycles, analyzing what I believe would make this
            project good vs great, and refining it based on the results and the feedback given, iteration factored heavily into my project
            by providing several different avenues in which I worked on my project and structured out how things would be reviewed instead
            of making a messy submission with no structure in what I was working on. 
        How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
            I have definitely learned more about how I would approach design as there are several different ways to add more realism to a 
            scene, such as lighting, textures, material connections, placements, and so much more. Learning how to do certain things and then
            implementing them in a testing ground and then applying them in my final project during the same week helped immensely as what I 
            learned was submitted all within one week, instead of having to back track to remember some minute detail that I might have forgotten
            causing my code to not work. 
    How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? 
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
        This can help if I ever wanted to graph or create scenes utilizing code that could come different applications or recreations I would want 
        to do. Especially since I can create movement controls, I could even use this newfound knowledge to create hide-and-seek or "Where's Waldo"
        type scenes. This will help expand my knowledge further as I would be learning more about what works and what doesn't, as well as messing 
        around with data and variables to accomplish tasks and expand upon their realistic features. This could also help me gain more experience to
        either apply for graphics positions and show off my created work to show how skilled I am in them, or by even posting them online to gain 
        popularity and maybe make commision off things other people would want me to create for them. There are several different avenues that this 
        can help me both academically and professionally.
