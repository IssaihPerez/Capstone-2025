# **Computer Science 499 ePortfolio**



## **Welcome**
Welcome to my ePortfolio, my name is Issaih Perez and this portfolio showcases
the knowledge and skills I have gained and developed throughout the years of
studying a Computer Science Degree while at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU).


## **Professional Self-Assessment**
Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have developed a broad and practical 
foundation in computer science, supported by real-world applications in software development,
data management, and cybersecurity. My experiences reflect a strong ability to work 
collaboratively, communicate effectively with stakeholders, and apply technical expertise in
data structures, algorithms, databases, and secure software development.


***Collaborating in a Team Environment:***
Collaboration has been central to my development as a software engineer. During my senior year
studying at SNHU, I worked on developing a video game prototype that consisted of 10 different working
assets and realistic interactions with the system. My responsibilities included the development of all
of the AI developed assets, different UI or HUD capabilities, and I coordinated closely with teammates
using Agile methodologies, closely monitored and recorded/saved the updated work using Git, and
coordinated/led daily follow up meetings to ensure smooth progress and accurate data retention. 


***Communicating with Stakeholders:***
Effective communication with non-technical stakeholders has been essential to translating technical
ideas into actionable solutions with non-technical audiences. Being able to effectively communicate
different design elements across varying levels of technical understanding will be paramount in my
success as communicating specialized information effectively helps further my developmental progress 
as well as my reputation as effective communication is one of the biggest hurdles developers might face. 

***Data Structures and Algorithms:***
My proficiency in data structures and algorithms is demonstrated through several challenging
projects. In one course, I designed and implemented a Order Tracking system for Quantigration using 
SQL which located different Orders, filtered them by various different options such as State, Item_SKU
Count, and Returns. Another course requested the design and implementation of a Course Planner that 
students can use to plan out their School Courses based off the Courses Name, Number, and Prerequisites. 
Said program parsed through an excel sheet and utilized a Hashtable to securely store pairs and read
the entries out to the user to help plan for their upcominig school courses.


***Software Engineering and Databases:***
During my numerous academic terms, I have developed quite a few different Software programs that both 
use and don't use databases. One such example came from one of my courses where the assignment was to
create a Top 5 Destinations List of various different states and include a clickable link that user(s)
can click on to view a travel agency that can help users book a trip to their desired location. Another
such course had me develop a DriverPass system that utilized a collection of different DMV databases as
well as different licensed driving instructors that students/users can use to help pass their driving
exams. This program utilized the active Driving Instructors accounts to allow people to create appointments
with available instructors as well as access DMV driving material to help prepare them for their test.


***Security:***
Security has been an important theme across several projects. For one such project, I developed a 
SSL BootSpring Application Server that utilizes SHA-256 Cipher Algorithm that helps encrypt files with
a Checksum signiature which in turn helps protect the files more securely. To help better improve the 
security of the BootSpring Application, I also utilized a Dependency Check program that helped go through
the applications Security Dependencies, which showcased varying levels of severity in regards to risk
factors when utilizing certain dependencies or libraries. I would go through each of the marked Dependencies,
assess the Vulnerability status of the specific packages, and work on updating said vulnerabilities or
suppressing false positives. Another course had me develop an Appointment Test class that allowed users to
create an appointment with a doctor, for a date that was in the future, along with varying levels of appointment
verification, such as Appointment ID Number, Description, and other factors. Once this program was set up, I
then would run said program through JUnit Tests to help test smaller pieces of the code and ensure they are
functioning properly, as well as to assess and protect any code from being accessed without it being properly
checked. I utilized Automated and Manual Testing to ensure that all programs, assertions, updates, and inputs
were being properly analyzed and checked to help reduce the overall vulnerabilities that bad actors might exploit.
