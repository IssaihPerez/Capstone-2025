# **Computer Science 499 ePortfolio**

## **Welcome**
Welcome to my ePortfolio, my name is Issaih Perez and this portfolio showcases
the knowledge and skills I have gained and developed throughout the years of
studying a Computer Science Degree while at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU).

## **Professional Self Assessment**
Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have developed a broad and practical
foundation in computer science, supported by real world applications in software development,
data management, and cybersecurity. My experiences reflect a strong ability to work
collaboratively, communicate effectively with stakeholders, and apply technical expertise in
data structures, algorithms, databases, and secure software development.

### ***Collaborating in a Team Environment***
Collaboration has been central to my development as a software engineer. During my senior year
studying at SNHU, I worked on developing a video game prototype that consisted of 10 different working
assets and realistic interactions with the system. My responsibilities included the development of all
of the AI developed assets, different UI or HUD capabilities, and I coordinated closely with teammates
using Agile methodologies, closely monitored and recorded/saved the updated work using Git, and
coordinated/led daily follow up meetings to ensure smooth progress and accurate data retention.

### ***Communicating with Stakeholders***
Effective communication with non technical stakeholders has been essential to translating technical
ideas into actionable solutions with non technical audiences. Being able to effectively communicate
different design elements across varying levels of technical understanding will be paramount in my
success as communicating specialized information effectively helps further my developmental progress
as well as my reputation as effective communication is one of the biggest hurdles developers might face.

### ***Data Structures and Algorithms***
My proficiency in data structures and algorithms is reflected in several challenging projects. In one
course, I built an Order Tracking system for Quantigration using SQL to locate and filter orders by state,
item SKU, count, and returns. In another, I developed a Course Planner that parsed Excel Data and use a 
hashtable to store and display course information, helping students plan their schedules based on the course
names, numbers and prerequisites. 

### **Software Engineering and Databases***
Throughout my academic terms, I've developed a variety of software programs, some database driven and others
standalone. One notable project involved creating a Top 5 Destinations List for various U.S. states, which
featured clickable links directing users to travel agencies that could assist in booking trips to their chosen
locations. This project focused on enhancing user interaction and providing helfpful resources. In another course,
I developd a DriverPass system that integrated multiple DMV databases and licensed driving instructor accounts. 
The application allowed users to shcedule appointments with available instructors and access official DMV study
materials, offering a streamlined exdperience for individuals preparing for their driving exams.
