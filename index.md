# **Computer Science 499 ePortfolio**

## **Welcome**
Welcome to my ePortfolio, my name is Issaih Perez and this portfolio showcases
the knowledge and skills I have gained and developed throughout the years of
studying a Computer Science Degree while at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU).

## **Professional Self Assessment**
Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have developed a broad and practical
foundation in computer science, supported by real world applications in software development,
data management, and cybersecurity. My experiences reflect a strong ability to work
collaboratively, communicate effectively with stakeholders, and apply technical expertise in
data structures, algorithms, databases, and secure software development.

### ***Collaborating in a Team Environment***
Collaboration has been central to my development as a software engineer. During my senior year
studying at SNHU, I worked on developing a video game prototype that consisted of 10 different working
assets and realistic interactions with the system. My responsibilities included the development of all
of the AI developed assets, different UI or HUD capabilities, and I coordinated closely with teammates
using Agile methodologies, closely monitored and recorded/saved the updated work using Git, and
coordinated/led daily follow up meetings to ensure smooth progress and accurate data retention.

### ***Communicating with Stakeholders***
Effective communication with non technical stakeholders has been essential to translating technical
ideas into actionable solutions with non technical audiences. Being able to effectively communicate
different design elements across varying levels of technical understanding will be paramount in my
success as communicating specialized information effectively helps further my developmental progress
as well as my reputation as effective communication is one of the biggest hurdles developers might face.






### ***Security***
Security has been a key theme across several projects. In one, I built an SSL BootSpring Application Server using
the SHA 256 cipher algorithm to encrypt files with a checksum signature for better security. I also integrated a
Dependency Check tool to analyze and address vulnerabilities in third party libraries, updating insecure packages
or suppressing false positives where appropriate. This helped minimize my projects security flaws and practiced
defensive design techniques when developing code. In another project, I developed an Appointment Test class that
allowed users to schedule future appointments with verification steps like ID numbers and descriptions. To test this
application, I used JUnit for automated testing of individual components, combining manual and automated methods to
ensure robust input validation and reduce potential vulnerabilities from unauthorized access or faulty logic.

# **Enhanced Artifacts**
Throughout this degree, I’ve developed a strong understanding of what it means to be a Computer Science
professional. The first key artifact I chose was from CS 250 Software Development Lifecycle and it demonstrates
my ability to apply well founded and innovative techniques in real world contexts. This project originally involved
a Java based application that launched an executable to display a browser interface, allowing users to explore
various travel destinations through clickable links. As part of improving the artifact, I ported the entire
application from Java to C Plus Plus, a challenging task that required learning and using CMake in place of Java’s Swing
framework. This transition involved thoughtful decision making and trade offs, particularly in adapting the interface
and preserving the application's functionality across different languages and platforms. Successfully recreating the
project in C Plus Plus not only reflects technical proficiency but also highlights my ability to adapt and innovate under
new constraints. From a collaborative perspective, I enhanced the project by integrating interactive features such
as external links, creating a more connected and engaging user experience. This supports collaboration and
information sharing across different systems, demonstrating how software can bridge gaps between various areas
within the field. By combining strong technical skills with a focus on usability and cross functional collaboration,
this artifact represents my growth as a well rounded and capable computer science professional.
