# **Enhanced Artifacts**
Throughout this degree, I’ve developed a strong understanding of what it means to be a Computer Science
professional. The first key artifact I chose was from CS 250 Software Development Lifecycle and it demonstrates
my ability to apply well founded and innovative techniques in real world contexts. This project originally involved
a Java based application that launched an executable to display a browser interface, allowing users to explore
various travel destinations through clickable links. As part of improving the artifact, I ported the entire
application from Java to C Plus Plus, a challenging task that required learning and using CMake in place of Java’s Swing
framework. This transition involved thoughtful decision making and trade offs, particularly in adapting the interface
and preserving the application's functionality across different languages and platforms. Successfully recreating the
project in C Plus Plus not only reflects technical proficiency but also highlights my ability to adapt and innovate under
new constraints. From a collaborative perspective, I enhanced the project by integrating interactive features such
as external links, creating a more connected and engaging user experience. This supports collaboration and
information sharing across different systems, demonstrating how software can bridge gaps between various areas
within the field. By combining strong technical skills with a focus on usability and cross functional collaboration,
this artifact represents my growth as a well rounded and capable computer science professional.

The second artifact I chose was from CS 330 Computational Graphics and Visualization and this artifact showcases my
ability to develop appropriate solutions to complex design problems while effectively balancing the trade offs that
come with different design decisions. The project, completed using the Virtual Lab environment, involved creating a 3D
mesh scenery application using various shapes and objects constructed through code. At the outset, I encountered a
challenge I didn’t have all the necessary files. To overcome this, I had to track down older versions I had saved
and update them to meet my current coding standards and requirements. This process required not just technical problem solving
but also a keen eye for detail and a strong sense of design consistency. Of the three artifacts I’ve selected, this one
was the most time consuming as much of my time was spent fine tuning and making deliberate choices about what elements
to emphasize. I had to carefully balance components such as lighting, shapes, textures, pitches, and other visual
elements. This iterative refinement process demonstrates my ability to evaluate trade offs, prioritize features, and
make informed decisions	skills that are essential both in academic settings and in professional client work.

The final artifact was pulled from CS 340 Client Server Development and demonstrates my ability to design, develop,
and deliver technically sound, professional quality work while applying a security focused mindset. Built in Python using
.ipynb and .py files, the project is a web application that interacts with a database of animals. I restructured the
original setup by consolidating multiple access points into a single entry, improving usability and security. I updated
the CRUD operations for better accuracy and implemented defensive programming practices, such as using .env files to protect
credentials and validating user input to prevent errors and null entries. While the backend functionality and CRUD logic work
as intended, I encountered an unresolved issue with the Jupyter Dash script. Due to limitations with the Dash server
environment in Virtual Lab, the dashboard cannot render externally. Despite this, the core logic performs as expected,
showcasing my problem solving and security aware development skills.
