# **Computer Science 499 ePortfolio**

## **Welcome**
Welcome to my ePortfolio, my name is Issaih Perez and this portfolio showcases
the knowledge and skills I have gained and developed throughout the years of
studying a Computer Science Degree while at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU).

## **Professional Self Assessment**
Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have developed a broad and practical
foundation in computer science, supported by real world applications in software development,
data management, and cybersecurity. My experiences reflect a strong ability to work
collaboratively, communicate effectively with stakeholders, and apply technical expertise in
data structures, algorithms, databases, and secure software development.

##### ***Collaborating in a Team Environment***
Collaboration has been central to my development as a software engineer. During my senior year
studying at SNHU, I worked on developing a video game prototype that consisted of 10 different working
assets and realistic interactions with the system. My responsibilities included the development of all
of the AI developed assets, different UI or HUD capabilities, and I coordinated closely with teammates
using Agile methodologies, closely monitored and recorded/saved the updated work using Git, and
coordinated/led daily follow up meetings to ensure smooth progress and accurate data retention.

##### ***Communicating with Stakeholders***
Effective communication with non technical stakeholders has been essential to translating technical
ideas into actionable solutions with non technical audiences. Being able to effectively communicate
different design elements across varying levels of technical understanding will be paramount in my
success as communicating specialized information effectively helps further my developmental progress
as well as my reputation as effective communication is one of the biggest hurdles developers might face.

##### ***Data Structures and Algorithms***
My proficiency in data structures and algorithms is reflected in several challenging projects. In one
course, I built an Order Tracking system for Quantigration using SQL to locate and filter orders by state,
item SKU, count, and returns. In another, I developed a Course Planner that parsed Excel data and used a
hashtable to store and display course information, helping students plan their schedules based on course
names, numbers, and prerequisites.

##### ***Software Engineering and Databases***
Throughout my academic terms, I’ve developed a variety of software programs, some database driven and others
standalone. One notable project involved creating a Top 5 Destinations list for various U.S. states, which
featured clickable links directing users to travel agencies that could assist in booking trips to their chosen
locations. This project focused on enhancing user interaction and providing helpful resources. In another course,
I developed a DriverPass system that integrated multiple DMV databases and licensed driving instructor accounts.
The application allowed users to schedule appointments with available instructors and access official DMV study
materials, offering a streamlined experience for individuals preparing for their driving exams.

##### ***Security***
Security has been a key theme across several projects. In one, I built an SSL BootSpring Application Server using
the SHA 256 cipher algorithm to encrypt files with a checksum signature for better security. I also integrated a
Dependency Check tool to analyze and address vulnerabilities in third party libraries, updating insecure packages
or suppressing false positives where appropriate. This helped minimize my projects security flaws and practiced
defensive design techniques when developing code. In another project, I developed an Appointment Test class that
allowed users to schedule future appointments with verification steps like ID numbers and descriptions. To test this
application, I used JUnit for automated testing of individual components, combining manual and automated methods to
ensure robust input validation and reduce potential vulnerabilities from unauthorized access or faulty logic.

# **Enhanced Artifacts**
Throughout this degree, I’ve developed a strong understanding of what it means to be a Computer Science
professional. The first key artifact I chose was from CS 250 Software Development Lifecycle and it demonstrates
my ability to apply well founded and innovative techniques in real world contexts. This project originally involved
a Java based application that launched an executable to display a browser interface, allowing users to explore
various travel destinations through clickable links. As part of improving the artifact, I ported the entire
application from Java to C Plus Plus, a challenging task that required learning and using CMake in place of Java’s Swing
framework. This transition involved thoughtful decision making and trade offs, particularly in adapting the interface
and preserving the application's functionality across different languages and platforms. Successfully recreating the
project in C Plus Plus not only reflects technical proficiency but also highlights my ability to adapt and innovate under
new constraints. From a collaborative perspective, I enhanced the project by integrating interactive features such
as external links, creating a more connected and engaging user experience. This supports collaboration and
information sharing across different systems, demonstrating how software can bridge gaps between various areas
within the field. By combining strong technical skills with a focus on usability and cross functional collaboration,
this artifact represents my growth as a well rounded and capable computer science professional.

The second artifact I chose was from CS 330 Computational Graphics and Visualization and this artifact showcases my
ability to develop appropriate solutions to complex design problems while effectively balancing the trade offs that
come with different design decisions. The project, completed using the Virtual Lab environment, involved creating a 3D
mesh scenery application using various shapes and objects constructed through code. At the outset, I encountered a
challenge I didn’t have all the necessary files. To overcome this, I had to track down older versions I had saved
and update them to meet my current coding standards and requirements. This process required not just technical problem solving
but also a keen eye for detail and a strong sense of design consistency. Of the three artifacts I’ve selected, this one
was the most time consuming as much of my time was spent fine tuning and making deliberate choices about what elements
to emphasize. I had to carefully balance components such as lighting, shapes, textures, pitches, and other visual
elements. This iterative refinement process demonstrates my ability to evaluate trade offs, prioritize features, and
make informed decisions	skills that are essential both in academic settings and in professional client work.

The final artifact was pulled from CS 340 Client Server Development and demonstrates my ability to design, develop,
and deliver technically sound, professional quality work while applying a security focused mindset. Built in Python using
.ipynb and .py files, the project is a web application that interacts with a database of animals. I restructured the
original setup by consolidating multiple access points into a single entry, improving usability and security. I updated
the CRUD operations for better accuracy and implemented defensive programming practices, such as using .env files to protect
credentials and validating user input to prevent errors and null entries. While the backend functionality and CRUD logic work
as intended, I encountered an unresolved issue with the Jupyter Dash script. Due to limitations with the Dash server
environment in Virtual Lab, the dashboard cannot render externally. Despite this, the core logic performs as expected,
showcasing my problem solving and security aware development skills.
