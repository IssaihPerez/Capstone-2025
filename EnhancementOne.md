# **Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering**


This artifact was initially one of the first coding projects I worked on during my time at
SNHU. The project's main assignment was for me to create an executable of a Top 5 Destinations
List of various U.S. states with links and images connected to it. My main goal was to improve
upon some starter code (Java specifically) I received and add some more details to the application.

This artifact was chosen to demonstrate my ability to use well founded and innovative techniques,
as I ported this Java program into C++, while maintaining the initial programs structure and 
purpose. The initial program was an executable that opened up a browser interface that users can
interact and scroll through. The page listed off different states with a link towards a travel agency
that users can use to book or plan out trips to their selected state. When looking into porting the
Java program into C++, I discovered that C++ doesn't have "Swing" capabilities like Java does, and
since the program was written using "Swing" I needed to figure out an alternative programming method
that has the same functionality as "Swing" in C++. After doing some researching and messing around I
learned about something called CMake, which is a programming tool I have never heard of before, and
found out that this tool is very similar to "Swing" in style but is for C++. After successfully porting
the program from one programming language to another, as well as learning another C++ tool I previously
never learned about, I can confidently say that I have showcased my ability to use well founded and
innovative techniques to improve this artifact. Looking at my accomplishments in more broader terms, the
added benefit of me adding in external links to other websites can help further the way my application
can be utilized, as collaborating with other resources (such as web browsers) can help improve the uses an
application can have, and further increasing the networking and connections one might have. Although having
nice pictures helps enhance the application visually, allowing the user to have further interactions as well
as providing ways for the user to keep progressing through the application to accomplish more than one thing
really helps make it shine. For this specific example, having an application that not only advertises different
places to travel but also provides ways for users to actually book or plan to travel to the listed places further
improves what we can do in the tech field and the reputation of Computer Scientists.

There were quite a lot of challenges that I faced during the enhancing of this artifiact, as figuring
out how to properly use and run CMake was no small feat, as I could barely find any documentation about the
program or any guides on how to troubleshoot it. There were several instances where I had to reinstall the
program because I forgot or didn't check off a specific box and it caused certain elements to not function
properly. Although this was a time consuming process, once I figured out the installation errors, it wasn't
smooth sailing as afterwards I had a couple issues when trying to run the program. A good amount of them
were user error, as I quickly learned I wasn't the most accurate when it came to typing out the C++ code
but after countless trials and erroring, I was able to figure out what was wrong and debug all the errors
and get the program to function. Below will be an example of one such user error I had, as I listed the
Programs Version to be 6.6.2 instead of 6.9.2, so when Visual Studio tried looking for an older version, it
kept throwing back an error.

Overall, this was a great learning experience, and I learned that making sure little pieces of
the project worked before doing the entire program was the way to go. Below will be a picture of
me making sure the actual program works before adding in the images, to where it will look like the
image above. Paying attention to the details is what helped me make sure I was successful in the
refinement of this artifact.
